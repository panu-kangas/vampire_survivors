# Vampires! ðŸ§›

**Vampires!** is a survival game built on top of an old Supercell code challenge template. Developed entirely by me, it is written in **C++** using the **SFML** library.  


The game was developed over **40 working hours**, adding new mechanics, enemies, and features on top of the original template. A full list of all additions and updates can be found in the `UpdateList.txt` file.

# About the game

In **Vampires!**, you play as the sole survivor of a terrible vampire outburst, and your goal is simple: survive the hordes and escape to safety.  

The game progresses in levels, so new challenges appear gradually â€” more vampires, new vampire types, and ever-shortening spawn times ensure the task is not easy.  

Luckily, you are armed! Your beloved **Lance** pierces through vampires, and the **Holy Pulse** ability deals area damage to your pointy-toothed foes. These abilities can be upgraded with **Skill Points** earned from completing levels.  

Good luck, and donâ€™t forget to bring garlic!

Oh, and on top of the vampire survival craziness, this project aims to provide clean and scalable code architecture so that future development is easy and smooth.
